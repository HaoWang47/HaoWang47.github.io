Interesting, I never learnt Fisher's exact test when I was undergrad. Or, my mind was out of the classroom when my professor was addressing this test. But in my very first Statistical Inference class when I was sophomore, Dr. Pu (Xiaolong) introduced hypothesis test with the Lady Tasting Tea experiment. I did not know this experiment was firstly mentioned by Sir R.A. Fisher (well, I did not know Fisher back then anyway). I found it the scenario very interesting and started to have a basic idea of what hypothesis testing is. Recently, Dr. Liu mentioned Fisher's Exact Test under the topic of Gene Differential Expression Analysis and talked about the Lady Tasting Tea story.

Before we go to Fisher's Exact Test, I want to describe the Lady Tasting Tea experiment again to refresh my memory.
